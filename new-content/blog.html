<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I was born in NY; grew up in NJ until I was 12; spent time in Argentina and Puerto Rico; lived in Houston for many years; graduated from the University of Oregon; recently visited Spain and have been in Portland for the last 6 years. I speak Spanish fluently.  My experience has left me with a great appreciation of cultural differences, fresh, wholesome, natural cuisine, wine and microbrews... and soccer.  Not relevant though. I began working in the healthcare industry 4 years ago because I intended to apply to medical school.  During my time there, I realized that it was not for me. I left health care since. </p>
